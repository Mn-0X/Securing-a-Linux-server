# let’s look at update
#When you run apt update it retrieves the latest version information from the package repositories that are specified in the software sources configuration file.
#All this command does is refresh the package index and ensure all package information is current.

apt update

#You can now probably guess what the upgrade command does. When this command is run, 
#it consults the local package index to see which packages have upgrades available.
#If any are available it will install the latest versions of those packages. 
#Be aware that you will be asked whether you want to upgrade the packages, so some interactivity is expected. However,
#you can automate this by running update along with the option -y like so:

apt -y upgrade

#Enable Automatic Updates
apt install unattended-upgrades

#Before moving on, a cautionary note: it’s not a good idea to enable automatic updates on production systems. 
#For development and home environments like mine, this is perfectly fine. However, for production environments
#it’s best to schedule defined maintenance windows for security patching and upgrades — 
#but only once you’ve tested how the updates will affect deployed products in a controlled development, or test, environment
